# Basic map with place search, authenticating with API keys

This example is a simple page that displays an interactive map and a search box that uses search functionality. [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/), [MapLibre GL Geocoder](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-geocoder) and [Amazon Location
Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location) are used to build the app. Authentication to this app is done using Amazon Location [API keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/using-apikeys.html).


## Create resources

Create Amazon Location resources for the app by following [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html#qs-create-resources).

## Configure

Open `main.js` and enter the API key, map resource name, place index name, and the region where the resources were created in.

## Run

Open `index.html` in your browser.
